# simple BASH scripts

## 2. slugme

Takes a text input and converts to a slug&mdash;lowercase, dashes instead of spaces and slashes, "-and-" instead of ampersand. Simpler than many other slugify scripts (for better or worse).  

Echoes the output and also copies it to the OS-X clipboard. So far doesn't accommodate multiple dashes, backslashes.
